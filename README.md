# Friend-Finder

### What is this?

A full-stack "friend finding" application based on compatibility... basically a dating app.

### How does it work?

User accesses the survey through the main button on the home page. Once on the survey page, the user is required to provide their name and a link to their profile photo. Friend Finder takes the users' survey results and compares them with the results from other users. When the user is matched with a new friend, a modal pops up with the name and picture of the user's new BFF. Failure to provide all required information results in a modal alert.
